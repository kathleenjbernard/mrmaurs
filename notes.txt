Spencer notes 9/10

Site asethetics: 
    Mr. Maurs logo top left 

    white dotted line under header
    top and bottom of hero should fade to black - with the top fade happening slower than the bottom 
    Above dotted line (header only) put stars but not too many. 

    Make samples of both asymmetrical and symmetrical black border fades so he can choose 

    Wants jumbotron to match physical label

Site details:
    Make links contrast more 
    each sauce has a story clickable little thing 
    embedded videos 
    twitter API embedded 
    comparable sauce spice levels 
    recipe ideas

Label:
    Edges of label fade to black with brushed metal in center 
    Black watermark overlay - crater/planet texture for both site and label. 
    Label should be extremely similar to site
    On label, no stars at bottom 

Hero background notes 9/25:
-pull down black, push up stars
-improve transition 
-remove half of stars 
-make stars more faint
-remove bigger stars 
-black division should be about an inch thick
